# Chubs-Hideout-Crafting-Expanded
A mod that lets users create hideout crafting recipes more easily and safely. 

Some sites to look up EFT item IDs:
  * https://eft.justemutarkov.eu/10988/items (Recommended for current version of AE [12.9])
  * https://tarkov-database.com
  * https://items.sp-tarkov.com
  * https://eft.maoci.eu

Huge thanks to AE's c0pyright for figuring how to add hideout crafting recipes and providing the templates! :)

# How to use
Edit the config.js file to create hideout crafting recipes. Take note of the mentioned sites above for item IDs.

# Compatibility
This mod was based from AE v2.0.7.1. This should be compatible with other AE versions that use the same file structure as that version.
